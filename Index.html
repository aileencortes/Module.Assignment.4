            <h3> Simply Sweets Journey</h3>
            <p>Simply Sweets started with a vision to bring delicious and fresh baked goods to as 
                many people as possible. Their vision consists of having every sweet tooth they can 
                reach to be satisfied. </p>
            <p>That's why they offer a multitude of customizations for their baked good. They also 
                have the option that allows customers to custom make a dessert in case of an allergy 
                or sweet preference. They want to make sure that everyone can enjoy something sweet 
                when they crave it. </p>
